<h1 align="center">Hello 👋, I'm David SaintAnna</h1>
<h3 align="center"> "As the snow flies<br>
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'<br>
A poor little baby child is born<br>
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)<br>
And his mama cries<br>
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need<br>
It's another hungry mouth to feed<br>
In the ghetto (In the ghetto)<br>
  People, don't you understand<br>
A child needs a helping hand<br>
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day<br>
Take a look at you and me<br>
Are we too blind to see<br>
Do we simply turn our heads<br>
And look the other way?<br>
